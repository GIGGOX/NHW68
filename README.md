## Hardware

I'm attempting to draw the PCB and its my first time drawing a PCB so 0 confidence it will work. I did my research and if you want to use it plz do your own research make sure it works.

I have not yet tested the PCB, the keyboard PCB currently looks like this:

![PCB](./picture/PCB.png)

The keyboard uses STM32F303CCT6, IS31FL3733 and have per Key RGB. You are free to do whatever to the PCB



~~I'm too lazy to post the 3d model today~~

Here is the fusion 360 3d mode, should be updating when I change stuff
